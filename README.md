🎵 Music Player Project - Step-by-Step Description
1️⃣ Project Overview
This project is a simple yet functional music player built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to play, pause, and switch between multiple songs. The design is minimalistic, featuring a song display, progress bar, and playback controls.

# 2️⃣ Project Structure
The project consists of three main files:
📌 HTML File: Defines the structure of the music player.
📌 CSS File: Styles the player for a visually appealing interface.
📌 JavaScript File: Adds interactivity, such as play/pause and song switching.

# 3️⃣ User Interface & Design
The music player has a clean and responsive layout with the following elements:
✅ Navigation Bar: Includes a back button and a menu button.
✅ Song Display: Shows the song title, artist, and cover image.
✅ Audio Player: Allows users to listen to songs.
✅ Progress Bar: Shows the current playback position and allows seeking.
✅ Control Buttons: Includes play/pause, next, and previous buttons.

The design ensures smooth interactions with a pink-themed player on a dark background for contrast. Buttons are rounded and have a shadow effect for a modern look.

# 4️⃣ Functionalities Implemented
This music player provides essential audio playback features:

🎵 Play & Pause: Users can start or stop the song with a single click.
⏩ Next & Previous: Allows switching between multiple songs.
📊 Progress Bar Control: Users can adjust the song position by dragging the bar.
🎧 Auto Update Progress: The progress bar updates in real time as the song plays.

The JavaScript logic ensures a smooth and responsive user experience, with dynamic song switching.

# 5️⃣ How It Works

2️⃣ Clicking next or previous switches the song from a predefined playlist.
3️⃣ The progress bar moves in sync with the song and allows manual seeking.

This ensures an interactive and enjoyable music listening experience.
